great, now make the entire app background that was previously white #fffcf6 and make the previous shades of black #292b2d if not already implemented, also where relevant a 3rd color accent that would be appealing to add to the app is XXX. Also add the attached image as the logo, so have it that when users load in, they are shown the logo via a loading page first, which then fades out to show the app interface.
